This github repository contains R code which applies the method RUVSeq on two datasets: 
(1) RNA-Seq data count matrix (SRcounts) from whole blood RNA-Seq of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome  patients and controls using the code as in "deSEQ.RUVgvariedKandL.R"
(2) Data from the Sequencing Quality Control Consortium  (SeQC) using "ruvseq-empirical-AvsB-cmd.R" and "ruvseq-empirical-CvsD-cmd.R"
